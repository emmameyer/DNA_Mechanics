# The breakdown of the contents of this directory follows
1. [initial.sh](initial.sh): runs pdb2gmx, outputs processed gro file, change input/output names per system, step 1
2. [put_it_in_a_box.sh](put_it_in_a_box.sh): puts the processed gro into a cubic box, change input/output names as needed, step 2
3. [first_em.sh](first_em.sh): double precision em (not necessary) done using the box gro file, maxwarn necessary to handle system charges, step 3
4. [solvate_add_ions.sh](solvate_add_ions.sh): solvates the system, adds ions, 0.150 M, runs second em, step 4
5. [nvt_npt.sh](nvt_npt.sh): nvt and npt steps, step 5
6. [correct_trajectory.sh](correct_trajectory.sh): corrects the trajectory md files, change names per usual, ensure EOF is selecting the right group from index file, step 6
7. [sbatch_md_production.slurm](sbatch_md_production.slurm): production run batch script to submit the run as a job on the OSC. It continues from npt, unless altered to continue from a previous production run, step 7.
8. [concatenate.txt](concatenate.txt): gromacs command for combining trajectory files. this is done when extending simulations. this concatenated xtc file is all you need for extending simulations, the gro and tpr file from the second simulation will work for analysis, no need to combine these.

## In general, the step by step process of simulation goes as follows:
1. Obtain PDB
    * If multiple strands/objects (such as dsDNA or a DNA and protein system) cause GROMACS errors: Separate the strands/objects to have separate .pdb files (strand1.pdb, strand2.pdb, dna.pdb, histone.pdb, etc.)
    * Do this in PyMOL by selecting each object separately and saving them separately by exporting molecule (as a pdb file)
2. Run gmx pdb2gmx on each object
    * gmx pdb2gmx -f {object1_name}.pdb -p {object1_name}.top -o {object1_name}_processed.gro -i posre_{object1_name}.itp -water tip3p -ff amber14sb_parmbsc1_cufix -merge all
    * gmx pdb2gmx -f {object2_name}.pdb -p {object2_name}.top -o {object2_name}_processed.gro -i posre_{object2_name}.itp -water tip3p -ff amber14sb_parmbsc1_cufix -merge all
3. If the strands/objects are separated, you need to create a main topology file. The main topology file is what combines the pieces back together into one piece. In this topology file, we need to call/reference the topology files generated for each object from pdb2gmx. In order to do this, we copy the contents of the topology files to itp files, that we can include in the main topology.
* cp {object*_name}.top {object*_name}.itp
* Do this for every object, * replaces numbers for this example (object1, object2, etc.)
* These new itp files are structured as topology files, so a few edits are required. Delete the #include forcefield line at the top of each, this includes your forcefield for the simulation, which will be defined in the main topology file and shouldn't be defined more than once. Also delete the rest of the lines at the bottom that isn't posre, starting with ; Include water topology down to the [molecules], only thing left at the end should be the position restraint file (take note of the compound names: DNA_chain_A & DNA_chain_B ). The posre itp file needs to remain included in this "new" itp file.
* The workflow gromacs follows is now such: system.top has lines #include object1.itp and #include object2.itp, which point to the itp files that were just made. These itp files hold the topologies of each piece of the system, and at the bottom they point to its position restraint file with #include posre_object1.itp (same for the second).
4. Create the main topology by copying a topology file that was outputted by pdb2gmx. It doesn't matter which one, you are using it as a template.
* cp {one_object}.top system.top
* Delete the [moleculetype] and everything below it until water topology, it should include the following:
*   #include forcefield
*   #inlcude "{object_name}.itp"
*   #include "{object_name}itp"
*   Water
*   Posres_water
*   Ions
*   System
*   Molecules: make sure the molecules are correct and in the same order as the include statements (strand1 and strand 2, DNA_chain whatever)
5. pdb2gmx outputs gro files as well that need to be combined. Merge the processed gro files together using MDAnalaysis, use [merge_gro_files.py](../code/merge_gro_files.py).
6. Make the object be in the center of a box aligned to the z-axis
* gmx editconf -f most_recent_gro_either_processed_or_merged.gro -princ -o system_aligned.gro
* gmx editconf -f system_aligned.gro -center 0 0 0 -o system_centered.gro
* Here is where you could rotate the system as well using -rotate to make it perfect.
* Put the system in the center of a box
* gmx editconf -f system_centered.gro -o system_box.gro -c -d 1.0 -bt cubic
7. Specifically on OSC, reserve one hour of interactive time for the following (sinteractive -A PGS0408 -N 1 -n 28 -t 01:00:00):
8. Run double precision energy minimization on the system prior to solvating (-maxwarn to handle charge). This step is not necessary, it minimizes the system without solvent/water/ions/whatever, good for unstable systems, like very small minicircles.
* gmx_d grompp -f inputs/em.mdp -c system_box.gro -p both_strands.top -o em.tpr -maxwarn 1
* gmx_d mdrun -v -deffnm em
9. Solvate the system with a concentration of 0.15 MOL NaCl
* gmx solvate -cp system_box.gro -cs spc216.gro -o system_solv.gro -p system.top
* gmx grompp -f inputs/ions.mdp -c system_solv.gro -p system.top -o ions.tpr -maxwarn 1
* gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o system_solv_ions.gro -p system.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral -conc 0.150
10. Second double precision energy minimization. The _d causes double precision, which is not necessary.
* gmx_d grompp -f inputs/em.mdp -c system_solv_ions.gro -p system.top -o em_2.tpr 
* gmx_d mdrun -v -deffnm em_2
11. NVT and NPT equilibration
* gmx grompp -f inputs/nvt.mdp -c em_2.gro -r em_2.gro -p system.top -o nvt.tpr
* gmx mdrun -v -deffnm nvt
* gmx grompp -f inputs/npt.mdp -c nvt.gro -r nvt.gro -t nvt.cpt -p system.top -o npt.tpr
* gmx mdrun -v -deffnm npt
12. Production run (short, 0.5 ns, runs can be done in the hour of reserved time, other wise, must submit as a job using gpu)
* gmx(_gpu) grompp -f inputs/md.mdp -c npt.gro -t npt.cpt -p system.top -o md.tpr
* gmx(_gpu) mdrun -deffnm md
